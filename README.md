# ML-Homework
This is my collection of my homework codes from Professor Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on coursera.  

Note: Not all of files belong to me for example I have used Porter Stemmer(which was written by Martin Porter)  algorithm for Spam Classifier. Also some part of code was provided directly by Coursera.
