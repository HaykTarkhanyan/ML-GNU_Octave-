# ML-Homework
This is my collection of my homework codes from Professor Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on coursera.  

Note: Not all of files belong to me for example I have used Porter Stemmer(which was written by Martin Porter)  algorithm for Spam Classifier. Also some part of code was provided directly by Coursera.



Most convenient way to see what code does is simply call ex# where # represents which file you want to run
